I am a physicist and aspiring data scientist.

During my PhD at 
[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/),
I have studied 
[superconducting quantum circuits](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/263668),
leading to [a number of publications](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5837-8407).

I am now looking to apply the physicist's insights in approaching complex systems
to real-world challenges involving large quantities of data.

I enjoy taking photographs and you can find some of them scattered
across this website.
