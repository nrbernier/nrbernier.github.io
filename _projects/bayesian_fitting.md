Here is presented a python module
used to fit models to data 
using Bayesian inference to extract 
the full probability of the model function.
The original code can be found
on the [github page](https://github.com/nrbernier/bayesian_fitting).

The following notebook is a walkthrough of the module code
with explanations.
